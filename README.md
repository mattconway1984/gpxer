GPXer
=====

GPXer is a GPX fixup tool used to fix up GPX tracks to apply an average speed
with jitter. Relatively simple and easy to use, it allows you to fixup GPX
tracks with simulated data using existing location points within the tracks.
This allows you to fix the speed travelled along different parts of the GPX 
data. This code is was written to explore GPX handling and to fix up some
old GPX routes I had lost.
